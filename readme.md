# Personal Wesite
Welcome to my personal website repo! This contains almost all the code
I use to run my website at [samcantor.tech](https://samcantor.tech). My aim is to promote open-source development and showcase some cool concepts I've 
picked up over the years, for educational and portfolio purposes. All
credit has been listed where it is due, and feel free to contect me if you have any questions! Cheers,
