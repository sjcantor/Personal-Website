						<h2>Cloud Computing & Machine Learning Internship</h2>
						<p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/DCL_Grey.svg" alt="DCL Logo" /></span>
							I worked at <a href="https://distributed.computer/">Distributed Compute Labs</a> for 4 months as an R&D Intern. During my time at DCL, I developed 
							new features and improvements to the back-end network, produced production quality code to the core platform 
							and designed programs to accelerate image classification using Deep Learning. My back-end development included
							designing and implementing a control framework for agents in a distributed network. This enabled developers to 
							receive status updates from remote compute stations and send alerts or commands to redistribute tasks if needed.
							<br><br><br>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/tensorflowjs_logo.png" alt="TFJS Logo" style="width:130px;height:130px;"/></span>
							In addition to my work with the core platform, I also researched and developed new methods to accelerate the training times of Deep Learning models. Specifically, 
							I tested different methods to parallelize stochastic gradient decent in neural networks. This enabled me to develop
							a unique solution to train an image classification model using the compute power made availible by DCL. The program
							accepts saved Keras models that can be built using Python and TensorFlow, and converts it to <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a>.
							You can select custom data that you want to train the model with, and configure features such as batch size and worker count
							if desired.

							Project Manager and ML Developer</h2>
						<p>
							I am currently an executive member on the Queen's Machine Intelligence and Neuroevolution Design team (<a href="https://qmind.ca/">QMIND</a>), and have been 
							on the team for over a year and a half. QMIND is a student-run AI hub for Queen's University in Kingston, with a goal of producing 
							and designing computer based models using neural networks to develop unique solutions to problems. As a project manager, my role is 
							to lead of group of five students in developing an end-to-end machine learning program during the school terms. This year, my team is 
							focusing on robotics and autonomous vehicles, and is designing a computer vision solution to enhance robot perception. We are deploying
							our solution on a <a href="http://www.robotis.us/turtlebot-3/">Turtlebot3 Robot</a>, and the program will use real-time object detection to search and navigate to any given object in 
							a room. We will be presenting our final product at the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on Artificial Intelligence 
							(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/the-westin-harbour-castle-toronto/canadian-undergraduate-conference-on-ai/432360644129084/">CUCAI</a>) 
							in March, 2020.
							<br><br><br>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/campqmind.jpg" alt="Camp QMIND" /></span>
							When I am not working on my project, I help provide resources and training to QMIND members regarding key concepts of machine learning. 
							I have provided presentation/tutorial sessions for over 200 students, teaching them the skills they need to train and deploy ML solutions 
							on Microsoft Azureâ€™s cloud computing platform. In my most recent presentation, I demonstrated how to create a simple machine learning
							model for the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST Dataset</a> that could be deployed on a Microsoft Azure Notebook. The benifits to 
							using Azure in this case would be the compute power, easy experimentation and ability to deploy your solution by creating a Docker, Web Service and 
							REST API. You can find a copy of the Jupyter Notebook that I provided to the students <a href="https://notebooks.azure.com/s-cantor/projects/coffee-demo/html/mnist_demo.ipynb">here</a>.

							Music Generation using AI - Project</h2>
						<p>
							On my previous year at QMIND, I worked with a group of students to develop an AI program that generates original music. 
							For this project, we applied an LSTM neural network to recognize patterns between 30 second audio clips and their corresponding 
							cover artwork. After training, we could test the model by sending any new image as an input, and the resulting output would 
							be an original song generated by the neural network based on that image. After hosting the application on a website, the program 
							could successfully generate and playback a unique short song based off any uploaded image, and this was demonstrated at the 
							2019 Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI. You can check out our project repository <a href="https://github.com/QMIND-Team/QMIND-Music">here</a>.
							<br><br>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/spotify_logo.svg" alt="Spotify API"></img></span>
							In order to successfully train our machine learning model, we needed to collect sufficient data. Using the Spotify Developers API, 
							we were able to get data such as album artwork, song genre, tempo, key and 30 sample audio clips for over 500 songs.

						<h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
						<p>I'm currently seeking an internship position starting in May 2020. I am looking to expand my skills in machine learning and software engineering,
							as well as surround myself in a fast-paced, forward-thinking environment. I have the skills and mindset to learn how to solve new problems and adapt
							to an unfamiliar field. If possible, I'm looking to integrate machine learning methods into music and audio production.
